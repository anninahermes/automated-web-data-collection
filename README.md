Automated Web Data Collection

# Course Description

The internet is an essential source of data for social science research, providing access to vast amounts of text and structured information. This course introduces students to methods for automated web data collection, focusing on practical applications in political science and other social sciences. Students will learn web scraping techniques, work with APIs, and process various data formats. Ethical and legal considerations will also be discussed.

# Scraping examples
## Easy
* Wikipedia (useful for networks etc.)
* Parties' press releases (Varies in difficulty)

* German Lobby Register (can get very complex)
* Web Search Results (DuckDuckGo)
* News articles

## Medium
* Korean election results (backend, JSON)
* Parliamentary protocols (sometimes as documents or PDFs)
* US live election data from the New York Times (JSON backend)
* Polls (Politico JSON)
* Doctolib appointment availability (JSON)
* List of far-right demonstrations from parliamentary query (parsing PDFs and geocoding)
* Privatization of state owned companies (Treuhand) map (https://treuhandanstalt.online/karte/)

## Difficult
